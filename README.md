# Space-BlackJack

## BlackJack rules

BlackJack is a popular card game played in casinos and online. The objective of the game is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to it as possible, without exceeding it. Each card in the game has a point value, with numbered cards worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) worth 10 points, and Aces worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's choice.
At the start of the game, each player is dealt two cards and the dealer receives one. Players then have the option to "hit" and receive additional cards to improve their hand or "stand" and keep their current hand. Players can continue to hit until they reach a total of 21 or choose to stand. If a player exceeds 21, they "bust" and automatically lose the game. Once all players have finished their turn, the dealer must continue to draw additional cards until they have a hand value of at least 17. If the dealer's hand is closer to 21 than the players'(but not exceeds 21), the dealer wins. If dealer's and players' hands are equal then dealer also wins.

## How to play

[Demo](https://powerful-bellsss.surge.sh/)

Player must bet an amount of money for each chosen spot (maximum 3) to start the game. Then, players need to decide whether to "hit" or "stand" after receiving their initial two cards. They can also double their bet if the hand is lower than 21.
If a player's two cards have a low value, they may choose to hit and request additional cards in an attempt to improve their hand's value. If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game immediately.
